# Marketcoin - P2P blockchain-based cryptocurrency market; fork of Bitcoin

Marketcoin facilitates *trustless* exchange of cryptocurrencies. Marketcoin, like Bitcoin, is a trustless system operated and maintained by its users. Just as Bitcoin challenges the status quo of currency, Marketcoin will challenge the status quo of currency markets. This decentralised cryptocurrency exchange will prompt new standards of acceptable counter-party risk, fairness, transparency, and accessibilty.

Marketcoin is a new cryptocurrency in its own right. Like Bitcoin, the blockchain facilitates a system of distributed value generation, transactions are based on public and private keys, there is no counter-party risk to hold or transfer, and there is no central authority.

Marketcoin, unlike Bitcoin, implements a novel blockchain structure and enhanced transaction functionality which allows the network to interface with each alternate chain. In addition, Marketcoin rejects contemporary market auction systems in order to prevent manipulation and HFT.

Marketcoin operates in a unique way. Orders are submitted for both sides of exchange. Once a block is produced, orders are ranked on both sides of the exchange from highest to lowest bid and progressively matched. For example, during a Bitcoin/Marketcoin trade, the order which pays the most Marketcoin for one Bitcoin is matched with the order which pays the most Bitcoin for one Marketcoin. The bid and ask are then averaged, and this is the exchange value for that particular match.

The Bitcoin community now has an opportunity to engineer a market from the ground up; to continue the greatest experiment economics has ever seen.
