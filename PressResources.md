# Draft Spiel

Marketcoin is a decentralised, blockchain-based, non-monetizable market for crypto-currencies. Marketcoin has its own coin, the ket (working name), associated with it. By leveraging the unique properties of blockchains, Marketcoin enables *trustless* exchange between crypto-currencies with minimal infrastructure. (Notably, Marketcoin only requires the Marketcoin client, and the two clients of the cryptocurrencies one wishes to trade between).

In addition to the above, it is currently planned that Marketcoin adopt a unique style of exchange, something that is open to discussion once the project begins to mature. At this stage Marketcoin will not operate with an orderbook, and so there is little information on market depth, however, it also does not operate instantaneously. Similar to Bitcoin, a signed order will not be evaluated until it is included in a block. Since the exact amounts to be exchanged are not decided until this point, Marketcoin offers some resistance to high performance computing and manipulation of markets.

The project is currently in its infancy. With luck, as the project develops it will attract enthusiastic volunteers in a similar fashion to Bitcoin, and may one day have its own foundation, or be adopted by the Bitcoin foundation.
