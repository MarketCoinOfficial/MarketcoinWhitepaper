## Why?

I believe that no market should have a central point of failure. I believe that no market should be controlled by a few individuals. I believe that markets are crucial to the future of humanity, and I believe that such a fundamental construct of society should not funnel wealth into the pockets of a few. I believe markets should be free, governed by their users, and should ultimately facilitate liquid trade, not profit-mongering.

This is why I'm creating Marketcoin.

Marketcoin is designed with a similar philosophy and implementation to Bitcoin. Just as Bitcoin challenges the status quo of currency, Marketcoin will challenge the status quo of currency markets. It will help establish new standards of acceptable counter-party risk, fairness, transparency, and accessibilty.

## How?

Marketcoin implements a novel blockchain structure in order to interface with each cryptocurrency being traded. The consequences of using a blockchain radically alter the mechanisms of how such a market operates.

## What?



# Draft Spiel

Marketcoin is a decentralised, blockchain-based, non-monetizable market `ambiguous` for crypto-currencies. Marketcoin has its own coin, the ket (working name), associated with it. By leveraging the unique properties of blockchains, Marketcoin enables *trustless* exchange between crypto-currencies with minimal infrastructure. (Notably, Marketcoin only requires the Marketcoin client, and the two clients of the cryptocurrencies one wishes to trade between `possibly ambiguous`). 

In addition to the above, it is currently planned that Marketcoin adopt a unique style of exchange, something that is open to discussion once the project begins to mature. At this stage Marketcoin will not operate with an orderbook, and so there is little information on market depth, however, it also does not operate instantaneously. Similar to Bitcoin, a signed order will not be evaluated until it is included in a block. Since the exact amounts to be exchanged are not decided until this point, Marketcoin offers some resistance to high performance computing and manipulation of markets.

The project is currently in its infancy. With luck, as the project develops it will attract enthusiastic volunteers in a similar fashion to Bitcoin, and may one day have its own foundation, or be adopted by the Bitcoin foundation.
