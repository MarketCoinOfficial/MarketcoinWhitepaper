# Marketcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Exchange System for Bitcoin-like Currencies

Draft for public comment and contribution

## Abstract

A peer-to-peer decentralized exchange system would allow the users of a currency market to also be the govening body. Removed from the burdon of an external regulatory body would allow such markets to become truly free. Furthermore, facilitating relationships between crypto-currencies enables greater monetary diversity, something that is required if economies are to become resilient to negative effects of their chosen monetary systems. We propose a system that expands upon Bitcoin to enable trustless, peer to peer exchange of Bitcoin-like currencies. By allowing the proof of work chain to be a culmination of several smaller chains representing each currency pair, markets can remain resilient from the impacts of one another, while still conserving the cryptographic advantages bestowed by the virtue of being a crypto-currency. In addition, our system is largely incompatible with modern high performance computing algorithms; instead of instantaneous trade, orders are culminated into a block, and then algorithmically matched. This prevents most HPC exchange strategies and eliminates the spread.
