# Marketcoin Grant Proposal

## Background

While at Bitcoin2013 it occurred to me that Marketcoin might be suitable for a grant from the Bitcoin Foundation. I'll be working on the grant application here, and feedback would be welcome.

You can find more information about grant proposals from the Bitcoin Foundation website, particularly [this post](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=159).

I spoke to Lindsay, Peter and Gavin about this idea during Bitcoin2013 and the unanimous answer was to write and submit an application. Gavin was a little hesitant until I explained it wasn't monetizable and would be built from the Bitcoin source code and inherit many of Bitcoin's properties. Gavin also suggested I attempt to make the application as non-technical as possible as some of the Foundation's board members don't have the technical understanding he does.

## Proposal and Clarification

This application is seeking a grant from the Bitcoin Foundation in order to help facilitate (but not fund) the development of Marketcoin - a Bitcoin-like system which enables trustless exchange between crypto-currencies - through the development of infrastructure needed to support an opensource project and the associated community. This will be modeled on the current infrastructure supporting Bitcoin development and the Bitcoin community. This will mostly be comprised of renting servers and purchasing domains and SSL certificates.

Particularly, the services and products under the :

* DNS Seeds for both the mainnet and testnet
* Main marketcoin website
* Community forums similar to bitcointalk
* Wiki similar to the bitcoin wiki
* Code testing infrastructure
* Marketcoin and testnet faucets
* Domains and SSL certificates

This list may be expanded at a later date; though only after liaising with the Foundation, of course.

The reason for the limited nature of this proposal is two-fold. First and foremost, Marketcoin is experimental and doesn't properly exist yet, so I do not feel comfortable asking the Foundation to heavily fund something that may not become viable. Secondly, until there is a community surrounding Marketcoin I do not believe it is appropriate to attempt to fund development, and I wouldn't feel comfortable accepting funds at this stage for that purpose.

The nature of the grant process means that if a small initial grant proves worth while and assists the creation and fruition of Marketcoin and its would-be-community, subsequent grants can be applied for, thus by deferring a grant proposal for development funding the viability of the project can be properly evaluated at minimum risk.

The timeframe for this proposal is 2 quarters. The budget below reflects this. At the end of this period I (or the community) will apply for another grant if required.

Currently, information - including the partially written whitepaper - on Marketcoin can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/XertroV/MarketcoinWhitepaper/)

### Overview of Marketcoin and the Bitcoin philosophy

Marketcoin is a project aiming to develop a new alt-coin which does not function as a currency so much (Bitcoin already does a good job of that) but functions as a currency exchange for potentially any crypto-currency built from the Bitcoin protocol.

The project will be forked from Bitcoin and will have a very similar network structure. This project is not aiming to run as a business or make money and it offers no more potential reward for the creator(s) than any other member of the community (in a similar fashion to Bitcoin). This is not a business idea, this is a decentralised network like Bitcoin.

#### A brief overview of Marketcoin

Marketcoin facilitates trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies. Marketcoin, like Bitcoin, is a trustless system operated and maintained by its users. Just as Bitcoin challenges the status quo of currency, Marketcoin will challenge the status quo of currency markets. This decentralised cryptocurrency exchange will prompt new standards of acceptable counter-party risk, fairness, transparency, and accessibilty.

Marketcoin is a new cryptocurrency in its own right, though works very similarly to Bitcoin: the blockchain facilitates a system of distributed value generation, transactions are based on public and private keys, there is no counter-party risk to hold or transfer, and there is no central authority.

But Marketcoin, unlike Bitcoin, implements a novel blockchain structure and enhanced transaction functionality which allows the network to interface with each alternate chain. In addition, Marketcoin rejects contemporary market auction systems in order to prevent manipulation and HFT.

Marketcoin operates in a unique way. Orders are submitted on both sides of the exchange. Once a block is produced, orders are ranked on both sides of the exchange from highest to lowest bid and progressively matched. For example, during a Bitcoin/Marketcoin trade, the order which pays the most Marketcoin for one Bitcoin is matched with the order which pays the most Bitcoin for one Marketcoin. The bid and ask are then averaged, and this is the exchange value for that particular match.

#### Marketcoin and the Bitcoin philosphy

Marketcoin may attain several important functions within the crypto-currency community which build upon and reinforce the values and philosophy embedded in Bitcoin.

Firstly, Bitcoin may not be able to scale easily - or be worth scaling - to the point where it can accomodate all manner of transactions taking place globally in accordance with its growth. Furthermore, Bitcoin may not be economically suitable for every community, and has no economic benefits specific to small real world communities (such as a small town). Thus, Bitcoin may not be the optimum choice of currency for some communities. Despite this, Bitcoin shows the potential for incredible innovation and dynamism within the world of alternate and complementary currencies. In order to facilitate the widest possible adoption of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin philosophy, there should be some method for communities to create a crypto-currency with particular properties that provide extra-economic benefit to said community (which could be as simple as forking the source code and writing some legislation), however, this potential may be crippled if there is not a method of moving value between alt-chains in a trustless and standardised manner. Marketcoin allows crypto-currencies to become separated from the current trust-based model of exchange commonly used today.

Secondly, Bitcoin plays the most significant role in the crypto-currency community today. I believe that one of Bitcoin's future roles in the global economy will be the ultimate "long distance" money. While it is true that all crypto-currencies have the potential for instant worldwide transfer, if you wish to exchange village-coin-1 for village-coin-2 there needs to be some method of exchange. While Marketcoin can provide trustless exchange between crypto-currencies, there are scaling issue in the planned network architecture where the number of currency-pairs used and the average time to find a block are proportionally related. If multiple markets based on Marketcoin emerge (to cater to different geographical areas, or perhaps themes of currencies, etc) it is required than an intermediate crypto-currency be used to move between exchanges due to Marketcoin's inability to directly trade with forks of Marketcoin. Bitcoin has the possibility of fulfilling this need due to the security of the network and potentially ubiquitous acceptance (between Marketcoin exchanges). This helps to solidify Bitcoin's role in world economics as the super-currency which helps secure and facilitate a proliferation of new, novel, and innovative community and complementary currencies.

Thirdly, Bitcoin has become as popular as it has due to its unique properties in the realm of currency. Marketcoin hopes to expand these properties into currency exchange. Such a groundbreaking application of Bitcoin technology will not only draw more attention to Bitcoin, but also further public debate on the issues of open currencies and currency systems. By providing proof of Bitcoin's potential outside the application of a single monetary system, Bitcoin can propel the public imagination beyond monetary freedom and into the realm of financial, political and democratic freedom. This will not only result in Bitcoin's embedded philosophy being taken more seriously, but will foster innovation in elements of the Bitcoin network (such as blockchain structure, proof-of-work algorithms, interdependance of crypto-currencies, etc) which may later be utilised to improve security or mitigate potential attacks on the Bitcoin network.

An example of this which may be of particular interest is the following: In the unfortunate circumstance the Bitcoin community becomes divided over an extremely controversial issue to the extent that something like 40% of the community use a client or protocol which is incompatible with the remaining 60%, the Bitcoin blockchain may be forked. Marketcoin would, in this situation, allow for transparent wealth reorganisation by facilitating trustless exchange between the two chains.

In summary, I believe Marketcoin has the potential to interact with Bitcoin on a number of symbiotic levels, from fertilising innovation in Bitcoin-like systems (both technically and economically) to diversifying the range of attention and discussion devoted to Bitcoin from both a political and academic frame of reference. Marketcoin has the potential to further the goal of "freeing people to transact on their own terms."

## Needs Assessment

The particular need addressed by this proposal is to facilitate community growth around the Marketcoin project. This proposal aims to ease the cost of infrastructure, which can be quite substantial, especially given the rate at which communities can expand around worthwhile projects.

## Goals/Objectives

Two core components of community infrastructure are required to facilitate the project. It is the goal of this proposal to aid the funding of this infrastructure. There is the network infrastructure, such as DNS seeds, and the public resources like the main website and community forums. As the project develops these costs can be supplemented by donations from the community in the same way that many elements of the Bitcoin community are today, however, this is difficult in such a project's infancy.

### DNS Seeds

Included in this proposal's boundaries is at least two seeds for both mainnet and testnet. These will be servers with static IPs dedicated to running up to date Marketcoin clients to enable users to easily join the network.

### Main website, wiki, forums, faucets

These particular services are all web based and will require server infrastructure to support. Where possible they will be combined to save costs, however, there are obvious cases where they will ideally be separate to avoid financial loss (particularly the faucets). 

These services are all required to facilitate a functional, organised community and to provide a centralised point of release of information which is useful for potential users, members of the press and other parties wishing to learn about Marketcoin.

### Code testing infrastructure

In order to produce the highest quality of code possible testing infrastructure will need to be created and maintained. This infrastructure will be directly modeled on the equivalent infrastructure that the Bitcoin community employs.

### Domains and SSL certificates

As with any such project, domains may need to be purchased depending on how quickly the project develops. I've taken the liberty of reserving a number of domains already (such as marketcoin.org) which will not be funded by this project. As the project reaches maturity control of these will be given to other members of the community, and I will consider this a donation at the time. I do not anticipate that renewal of domains will fall under this grant application.

Some resources will need SSL certificates to ensure users' security, such as the forums.

## Methodology

Items listed above will be paid for as they are needed. Software solutions will be completely open source, including the main site (I suspect forking the Bitcoin site is the best way to go in the beginning).

As Marketcoin will be forked from Bitcoin many applications will be cross compatible (like the faucets) and these will be employed where possible.

Servers will be setup with well supported distributions such as Ubuntu 12.04 LTS using standard packages such as Apache2, MySQL, and PHP5.

## Estimated costs/budget

As the project develops more servers will be required. Two possible extremes are presented below to reflect the bounds of the budget.

Firstly, a fast, overly ideal timeline over 6 months:
* 3 servers for the main site, forums and wiki immediately. [18 server-months]
* Domains and SSL certs for forums and wiki immediately. [2 domain-ssl combos]
* Code testing server immediately. [6 server-months]
* 2 testnet seeds in 1 month's time. [10 server-months]
* Testnet faucet, domain and SSL cert in 1 month's time. [1 domain-ssl combo and 5 server-months]
* 2 mainnet seeds in 3 month's time. [6 server-months]
* Mainnet faucet, domain and SSL certificate in 3 month's time. [1 domain-ssl combo and 3 server-months]

This adds to 4 domain-ssl combos ((US10 + US30) * 4 = US160) and 48 server-months (48 * US40 = US1920). A grand total of US2080. At current exchange rates this is ~19 BTC.

A more realistic timeline over 6 months:
* 1 server for the main site, forums and wiki immediately. [6 server-months]
* SSL certificate for forums and wiki (and main site) immediately. [1 SSL certificate]
* Code testing server immediately. [6 server-months]
* 2 testnet seeds in 3 months time. [6 server-months]
* Testnet faucet, domain and SSL certificate in 3 month's time. [1 domain-ssl combo and 3 server-months]
* Mainnet seeds not needed.
* Mainnet faucet not needed.

This adds to 2 domains (US20), 1 SSL certificate (US30), and 21 server-months (21 * US40 = US840). A grand total of US890, or ~8 BTC at current exchange rates.

I only consider the last timeline truly feasible. This proposal therefore asks for 14 BTC from the foundation to assist in the creation of this infrastructure. 

I am asking for more than 8 BTC for two reasons. Firstly, if progress is faster than anticipated then there is a buffer, and secondly the BTC exchange rate is volatile and in accordance with paying for things on a when-needed basis there is necessary exposure to exchange rates.

Prices were estimated based on approximate cost of domains, cheaper SSL certificates, and the 2GB Linode package.

## Qualifications

The main requirement to fulfil the proposal is experience with server infrastructure and management. In addition, some programming experience will be needed in areas such as HTML and JS, PHP or another language relevant to web development, and possibly other more general languages such as Python. The reason these were given as an example is because the author has experience in these particular languages (among others).

Currently I'm working as a web developer for a reputable organisation. If the Foundation would like more details and references I'd be happy to provide them over private communications.

I have no relevant formal qualifications. I've completed two university level software courses achieving a mark of 86 (high distinction) in Intro to Artificial Intelligence (3rd year course from the University of Sydney) and 77 (distinction) in Advanced Informatics (1st year course form the University of Sydney). Academic records can be provided upon request.
